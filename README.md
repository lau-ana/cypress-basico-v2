# cy-data-test
Sample project to demonstrate a cy.dataTest Cypress custom command.

# Pre-requirements
It is required to have Node.js and npm installed to run this project.

I used versions v16.13.2 and 8.1.2 of Node.js and npm, respectively. I suggest you use the same or later versions.

# Installation
Run 'npm install' (or npm i for the short version) to install the dev dependencies.

# Tests

You can run tests simulating a desktop or mobile viewport.

### Desktop

Run npm test (or npm t for the short version) to run the test in headless mode.

Or, run npm run cy:open to open Cypress in interactive mode.
